            NASSA Group is profoundly committed to the vital role of education in Bangladesh in achieving
            socio-economic, financial and commercial growth.
            <br><br>

            We believe that by investing in education and training we lay the foundations for future generations of
            Bangladeshis to negotiate, determine and drive their own economic futures. 80% of the population of
            Bangladesh lives in rural and agricultural areas. For development to be impactful it is important to align
            education and training to natural trends in the economy. Therefore NASSA is proud to be funding a new
            agricultural university. The University will train a new generation of Bangladeshis in modern agricultural
            techniques that will equip them to support themselves, their families, communities and Bangladeshâ€™s economy
            as a whole.
